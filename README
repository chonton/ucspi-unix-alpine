UNIX-domain socket client-server command-line tools

unixclient and unixserver are command-line tools for building UNIX
domain client-server applications.  unixclient connects to a UNIX domain
socket and runs a program of your choice.  unixserver creates a UNIX
domain socket, waits for incoming connections and, for each connection,
runs a program of your choice.

unixclient and unixserver conform to UCSPI, the UNIX Client-Server
Program Interface, using UNIX domain sockets.  UCSPI tools are available
for several different networks.
